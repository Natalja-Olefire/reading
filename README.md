# reading
This simple program helps children to master their reading skills by showing them single word for reading. Word is shown on the screen and is changed on mouse click or tap on mobile devices. Current default version is in Russian, but you can download/run aplication and supply your own files in any language.

Accesible from: https://natalja-olefire.github.io/reading/ 

Word lists are stored in the **words** folder, and default loaded file is "default.txt".
You can load other file from the same folder, passing "file" parameter in the URL: https://natalja-olefire.github.io/reading/?file=complex.txt

To create your own application copy, download or clone repository, and open <your_path>/reading/index.html , or <your_path>/reading/index.html/?file=<your_file_from_words_directory> .

In your own copy you can add your words files in **words** directory, or replace existing ones, and pass them as "file" parameter to your URL (as it is shown above).
